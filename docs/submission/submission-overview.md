## How to submit models to CancerModels.org

Our data submission process happens in 4 major steps:

1. ### Filling the templates: 

    You can find our metadeta template on the [Metadata Dictionary](/dictionary) page. The metadata template is divided into 6 modules describing the minimal information about the model. 
    
2. ### Metadata validation:

    After filling the templates you can validate your model metadata using our validation service, which can be found [here](/validator). Here's a guide on [how to use the validator](/docs/validation/how-to-use) and to understand the errors you can refer to [validation report](/docs/validation/error-report) and our data model by exploring the [Metadata dictionary](/dictionary).
